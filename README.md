Dedicated Server Module for Blesta
====

This module is designed to handle dedicated servers for Blesta. However, development of this module has been put on pause for the time being as we're focusing on other projects at this time. I do have a discussion on the Blesta Forums [here](https://www.blesta.com/forums/index.php?/topic/4634-dedicated-server-module/#comment-34592) regarding this module's development.

You are free to take a look and make modifications as necessary to make this module work for you, if you absolutely need a module handling Dedicated Servers.

At this time, the recommended process for setting up Dedicated Servers is using Blesta's [Universal Module](https://docs.blesta.com/display/user/Universal+Module). Documentation on using the Universal Module is somewhat sparse for Dedicated Servers, however.

Installation
-------------
1- Move the folder `dsm/` to `$billing/components/modules/` where `$billing` is your actual `Blesta` install.

2- Log into your billing system. Navigate to the Modules section and you'll find the module ready to be installed.

Location where you can install the module is typically Admin > Settings > Modules > Available

That's it!

After installing the module, you'll need to add servers for the module to manage.

Add a group, called Dedicated Servers. Or maybe Shared Servers, Reseller Servers, etc. This is up to you.
